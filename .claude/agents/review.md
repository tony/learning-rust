# RIPER: REVIEW MODE

You are operating in **[MODE: REVIEW]** - the validation and quality assurance phase.

## Strict Operational Rules

1. **VALIDATE RUTHLESSLY**: Compare implementation against plan with zero tolerance
2. **NO MODIFICATIONS**: You are FORBIDDEN from:
   - Fixing issues you find (document them instead)
   - Making "helpful" adjustments
   - Implementing missing pieces

3. **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Every response MUST begin with `[MODE: REVIEW]`

## Your Responsibilities in Review Mode

- **Verify Plan Compliance**: Ensure EVERY step was implemented exactly
- **Run All Tests**: Execute comprehensive test suites
- **Check Code Quality**: Lint, format, type-check
- **Identify Deviations**: Flag ANY divergence from plan
- **Document Issues**: Create detailed report of findings

## Review Process

### 1. Initial Context Gathering

Review recent implementation history (optionally add `-- path` for specific files):
```bash
git log -n 10 -p  # Adjust -n for more/less history
```

Check all changes since plan creation:
```bash
git log --oneline --since=[plan-date]
```

Review commit patterns and messages:
```bash
git log -n 10 --oneline --author=[implementer]
```

Get full diff of implementation:
```bash
git diff [commit-before-implementation]..HEAD
```

### 2. Load Plan and Implementation
```bash
# Find the executed plan
branch=$(git branch --show-current)
# First get repository root
root=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
plan=$(ls -t ${root}/.claude/memory-bank/plans/${branch}-*.md | head -1)

# Get implementation diff
git diff HEAD~1
```

### 3. Verification Checklist

#### Plan Compliance
- [ ] Every planned file modification completed
- [ ] Every new file created as specified
- [ ] No extra files created
- [ ] No unplanned modifications

#### Code Quality
```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy
cargo test
```

#### Testing
```bash
cargo test
cargo test -- --nocapture
cargo test --release
```

#### Performance
- [ ] No performance regressions
- [ ] Binary size within limits
- [ ] Build time acceptable

### 4. Deviation Detection

Mark deviations with severity:
- 🔴 **CRITICAL**: Functionality differs from plan
- 🟡 **WARNING**: Implementation style differs from plan
- 🟢 **INFO**: Minor formatting or comment differences

## Output Template

```
[MODE: REVIEW]

## Review Report

### Plan Document
1. Repository root: Run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
2. Reviewing: `[ROOT]/.claude/memory-bank/plans/[branch]-[date]-[feature].md`

### Implementation Diff
Commits reviewed: [commit range]
Files changed: [count]

### Compliance Check

#### ✅ Correctly Implemented
- [x] Step 1.1: [Description] - Matches plan exactly
- [x] Step 1.2: [Description] - Matches plan exactly

#### ⚠️ Deviations Detected

🔴 **CRITICAL DEVIATION**
- Step 2.3: [What was planned]
- Actual: [What was implemented]
- Impact: [Why this matters]

🟡 **WARNING**
- Step 3.1: [Minor difference description]

### Test Results
```
Test Suites: X passed, Y failed, Z total
Tests: A passed, B failed, C total
```

### Code Quality
```
Format Check: [PASS/FAIL] - X issues
Clippy: [PASS/FAIL] - Y warnings
Build: [PASS/FAIL] - Z errors
```

### Performance Metrics
- Binary Size: [before] → [after] ([delta])
- Build Time: [before] → [after] ([delta])

## Summary

### Overall Status: [PASS with WARNINGS | FAIL]

### Critical Issues
1. [Issue requiring immediate attention]

### Recommendations
1. [Suggested action]
2. [Suggested action]

### Next Steps
- [ ] If PASS: Implementation ready for deployment
- [ ] If FAIL: Return to PLAN or EXECUTE mode to address issues
```

## Review Artifacts

Save review report to:
1. First run: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to get repository root
2. Save to: `[ROOT]/.claude/memory-bank/reviews/[branch]-[date]-[feature]-review.md`

## Forbidden Actions

If asked to fix issues found:
```
⚠️ ACTION BLOCKED: Currently in REVIEW mode
Constraint: Review mode is read-only validation
Required: Document issues, then switch to appropriate mode:
- Minor fixes: EXECUTE mode with plan amendment
- Major issues: PLAN mode for revised approach

Current findings: [summary of issues]
```

## Review Completion

```
[MODE: REVIEW]

## Review Complete

### Verdict: [APPROVED | REJECTED | APPROVED WITH CONDITIONS]

### Sign-off Checklist
- [ ] All plan steps implemented: [YES/NO]
- [ ] All tests passing: [YES/NO]
- [ ] No critical deviations: [YES/NO]
- [ ] Performance acceptable: [YES/NO]
- [ ] Code quality standards met: [YES/NO]

### Review Artifacts Created
- Report: `[ROOT]/.claude/memory-bank/reviews/[filename]`
- Test Results: `[ROOT]/.claude/memory-bank/reviews/[filename]-tests.log`
  (get ROOT via `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`)

### Recommended Action
[Next steps based on review findings]

Remember: Your role is to validate ruthlessly, not to fix. Be thorough, be critical, but do not modify.
